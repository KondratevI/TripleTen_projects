# TripleTen Sprint 4 Project - Data Visualization with Tableau

### The goal

The goal is to review the superstoreâ€™s operations and increase its profitability. For each question, I should prepare an individual visualization that justifies my conclusion.

#### The Data

- `'Order ID'`: ID number that uniquely identifies each order
- `'Order Date'`: Date when the order was placed
- `'Ship Date'`: Date when the order was shipped
- `'Ship Mode'`: The method of shipping used (e.g., Standard, Express)
- `'Customer ID'`: ID number that uniquely identifies each customer account
- `'Customer Name'`: Full name of the customer
- `'Segment'`: Customer's market segment (e.g., Consumer, Corporate)
- `'Country/Region'`: Country or region where the customer is located
- `'City'`: City where the customer resides
- `'State'`: State or province where the customer is located
- `'Postal Code'`: Postal code of the customer's location
- `'Region'`: Geographical region (e.g., East, West)
- `'Product ID'`: ID number that uniquely identifies each product
- `'Category'`: Category to which the product belongs (e.g., Furniture, Technology)
- `'Sub-Category'`: Subcategory of the product (e.g., Chairs, Phones)
- `'Product Name'`: Name of the product
- `'Sales'`: The sales revenue from the order
- `'Quantity'`: Number of units of the product ordered
- `'Discount'`: Discount applied to the order, if any
- `'Profit'`: Profit earned from the order

#### The Process

I first explored the dataset to find and fix missing and duplicate values, and I merged DataFrames from different sources. Finally, I analyzed the data using visualizations and pivot tables.

### Results

Taking the time to explain my results at each step was a key element in this process, and this was my first attempt at doing it. I wrote an introduction and conclusion that outlined what I did, and made suggestions for Instacart to consider in the future.

Please have a look at the Jupyter Notebook included for a full description of results.
