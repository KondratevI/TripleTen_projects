# Project - Data Visualization with Python

### The goal

The goal is to review the superstoreâ€™s operations and increase its profitability. For each question, I should prepare an individual visualization that justifies my conclusion.

#### The Data

The dataset contains the results of a mock study where 100 red squirrels were given one of three different diets after weaning, and their full grown adult weights were recorded. The figure below displays the results of the study, and this is the figure that you need to recreate.


#### Process and Results

The project was divided into three parts:
- **Profits & Losses:** Identified the biggest profit and loss centers, recommended products to stop selling, found the relationships between total numbers of sales and returns.
- **Advertising:** Identified the best states and months for advertising, calculating the return on ad spend ratio.
- **Returned Items:** Analyzed the return rates of products and examined the relationship between profit and return rates.
