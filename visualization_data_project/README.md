# Project - Data Visualization with Python

### The goal

This project involves the visualization of data collected from a mock study where 100 red squirrels were assigned one of three different diets after weaning. The objective of the study was to observe how different diets affected the squirrels' adult weights.
The goal of the visualization is to clearly show the weight differences across the three diet groups and provide insights into the potential impact of diet on growth.

#### The Data

The dataset contains the weight measurements of the squirrels when they reached adulthood, grouped by the type of diet they received. 

#### Process and Results

- **Diet Comparison:** Compare the mean adult weights of squirrels in each diet group.
- **Distribution of Weights:** Display the distribution of adult weights within each diet group to understand variance and central tendencies.
- **Outliers and Trends:** Identify any outliers and trends that may indicate a diet's effectiveness or anomalies in the data.
