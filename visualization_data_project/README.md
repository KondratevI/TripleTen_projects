# Project - Data Visualization with Python

### The goal

This project involves the visualization of data collected from a mock study where 100 red squirrels were assigned one of three different diets after weaning. The objective of the study was to observe how different diets affected the squirrels' adult weights.
The goal of the visualization is to clearly show the weight differences across the three diet groups and provide insights into the potential impact of diet on growth.

#### The Data

The dataset contains the weight measurements of the squirrels when they reached adulthood, grouped by the type of diet they received. 

#### Process and Results

The project was divided into three parts:
- **Profits & Losses:** Identified the biggest profit and loss centers, recommended products to stop selling, found the relationships between total numbers of sales and returns.
- **Advertising:** Identified the best states and months for advertising, calculating the return on ad spend ratio.
- **Returned Items:** Analyzed the return rates of products and examined the relationship between profit and return rates.
