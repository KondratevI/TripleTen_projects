# Project - Data Visualization with Python

### The goal

The goal is to review the superstoreâ€™s operations and increase its profitability. For each question, I should prepare an individual visualization that justifies my conclusion.

#### The Data

- `'Order ID'`: ID number that uniquely identifies each order
- `'Order Date'`: Date when the order was placed
- `'Ship Date'`: Date when the order was shipped
- `'Ship Mode'`: The method of shipping used (e.g., Standard, Express)
- `'Customer ID'`: ID number that uniquely identifies each customer account
- `'Customer Name'`: Full name of the customer
- `'Segment'`: Customer's market segment (e.g., Consumer, Corporate)
- `'Country/Region'`: Country or region where the customer is located
- `'City'`: City where the customer resides
- `'State'`: State or province where the customer is located
- `'Postal Code'`: Postal code of the customer's location
- `'Region'`: Geographical region (e.g., East, West)
- `'Product ID'`: ID number that uniquely identifies each product
- `'Category'`: Category to which the product belongs (e.g., Furniture, Technology)
- `'Sub-Category'`: Subcategory of the product (e.g., Chairs, Phones)
- `'Product Name'`: Name of the product
- `'Sales'`: The sales revenue from the order
- `'Quantity'`: Number of units of the product ordered
- `'Discount'`: Discount applied to the order, if any
- `'Profit'`: Profit earned from the order

#### Process and Results

The project was divided into three parts:
- **Profits & Losses:** Identified the biggest profit and loss centers, recommended products to stop selling, found the relationships between total numbers of sales and returns.
- **Advertising:** Identified the best states and months for advertising, calculating the return on ad spend ratio.
- **Returned Items:** Analyzed the return rates of products and examined the relationship between profit and return rates.
