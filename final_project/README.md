# Final Project

### The goal

Finding the most profitable and the less profitable divisions, segments and categories of the products.

#### The Data
It was provided a backup of the database in the SQLite format no CSV files will be provided.
The condition of the project was Ð¾nly use connections to the database itself, and not to load the whole database to CSV.

The data was spread across six tables:
- `dim_customer`: contains customer-related data.
- `dim_product`: contains product-related data
- `fact_pre_discount`: contains pre-invoice deductions information for each product
- `fact_manufacturing_cost`: contains the cost incurred in the production of each product
- `fact_gross_price`: contains gross price information for each product
- `fact_sales_monthly`: contains monthly sales data for each product.

### Process and Results

#### Step 1: Data Preprocessing
- **Checked for missing values:** Identified and handled any missing data in the dataset.
- **Checked for duplicated values:** Detected and removed any duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.
- **Checked for incorrect column names:** Verified that column names were consistent and clear.
- **Checked for data type correspondence:** Ensured that each column had the correct data type (e.g., integers, floats, dates).
- **Checked for misprints:** Identified any errors or inconsistencies in data entries (such as spelling mistakes or wrong values).
- **Checked for wrong lower or higher cases:** Ensured text data was consistent in terms of letter casing (e.g., "Sales" vs. "sales").
- **Checked for outliers**: Identified any extreme values that could skew the results and decided how to handle them.
- **Corrected data:** Made necessary corrections to the data to ensure accuracy.
- **Deleted data:** Removed any data that could not be corrected or was irrelevant.
#### Step 2: Financial Analysis
- **Calculated total revenue by years and months:** Computed total revenue for each year and month, then plotted the corresponding graph.
- **Calculated total profit by years and months:** Computed total profit for each year and month, then plotted the corresponding graph.
- **Calculated total margin by years and months:** Calculated the total margin (profit/revenue) by year and month, then plotted the corresponding graph.
- **Calculated revenue by divisions by years and months:** Determined the revenue per division over time (yearly and monthly), then plotted the corresponding graph.
- **Calculated profit by divisions by years and months:** Calculated the profit per division by year and month, then plotted the corresponding graph.
- **Calculated margin by divisions by years and months:** Calculated the margin per division by year and month, then plotted the corresponding graph.
- **Calculated revenue by segments by years and months:** Determined the revenue per segment over time (yearly and monthly), then plotted the corresponding graph.
- **Calculated profit by segments by years and months:** Calculated the profit per segment by year and month, then plotted the corresponding graph.
- **Calculated margin by segments by years and months:** Calculated the margin per segment by year and month, then plotted the corresponding graph.
- **Calculated revenue by categories by years and months:** Computed revenue by categories over time (yearly and monthly), then plotted the corresponding graph.
- **Calculated profit by categories by years and months:** Computed profit by categories over time (yearly and monthly), then plotted the corresponding graph.
- **Calculated margin by categories by years and months:** Computed margin by categories over time (yearly and monthly), then plotted the corresponding graph.
- **Found the most profitable divisions, segments, and categories of the products:** Identified the best-performing parts of the business.
- **Found the least profitable divisions, segments, and categories of the products:** Identified the underperforming parts of the business.
- **Identified unprofitable divisions, segments, or categories of the products:** Determined if there were any areas that were not generating profit.
- **Provided recommendations:** Suggested improvements based on the analysis.
