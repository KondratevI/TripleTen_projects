# Final Project

### The goal

Finding the most profitable and the less profitable divisions, segments and categories of the products.

#### The Data
It was provided a backup of the database in the SQLite format no CSV files will be provided.
The condition of the project was Ð¾nly use connections to the database itself, and not to load the whole database to CSV.

The data was spread across six tables:
- `dim_customer`: contains customer-related data.
- `dim_product`: contains product-related data
- `fact_pre_discount`: contains pre-invoice deductions information for each product
- `fact_manufacturing_cost`: contains the cost incurred in the production of each product
- `fact_gross_price`: contains gross price information for each product
- `fact_sales_monthly`: contains monthly sales data for each product.




### Process and Results

#### Step 1: Data Preprocessing
- **Handled missing values:** Identified and filled in missing values in key columns (orders, visits, group, order size, price).
- **Removed duplicates:** Checked for and removed duplicate rows to avoid distorting the analysis results.
#### Step 2: Visualization
- **Cumulative revenue by group:** Plotted the cumulative revenue for both groups.
- **Cumulative average order size by group:** Plotted the cumulative average order size.
- **Relative difference in cumulative average order size between groups:** Plotted the difference in average order size between groups A and B.
- **Scatter plot of orders per user:** Plotted the number of orders per user.
- **Scatter plot of order prices:** Plotted the order prices.
- **Daily conversion rates for both groups:** Plotted the daily conversion rates for both groups.
#### Step 3: Calculations
- **Conversion rate for each group:** Calculated the conversion rate for each group (the ratio of orders to visits per day).
- **95th and 99th percentiles for orders per user:** Calculated the percentiles for the number of orders.
- **95th and 99th percentiles for order prices:** Calculated the percentiles for the order prices.
#### Step 4: Statistical Analysis
- **Statistical significance of the conversion difference between groups (raw data):** Tested whether the conversion rates between the groups were statistically significant using a t-test.
- **Statistical significance of the average order size difference between groups (raw data):** Tested whether the average order size difference between the groups was statistically significant.
